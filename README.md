# Lab7

I solved the compulsory part :

3 players were created and sizek is hardcoded with value 4 .

Every player has a synchronised method overriden in run() .

The threads are started and delared in the game class .

Everytime a tooken is taken, there is a displayed message.

The winner is determined ether when the board is empty of tokens or when one of them reaches a aritmetic progression of sizeK . The function for determining the longest aritmetic progression in a set of tokens is taken from a site and the link is commented at he beginning of the function .

The program succesfully shows the threads functionality of threads, as the players never took the same token from the board .

An example of how the program works is given in the attached photo .
